    "\n",
    "2.Data Format: REST services use lightweight data formats like JSON or XML to transmit data, while SOAP services use XML to encode data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.URI Structure: REST uses a URI structure to uniquely identify resources and uses standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on those resources. SOAP, on the other hand, uses WSDL to define a contract for a service and uses SOAP messages to perform operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Overhead: REST services are lightweight and have minimal overhead, while SOAP services are more heavyweight due to the use of XML and the additional SOAP envelope and headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Scalability: REST services are more scalable than SOAP services as they have a simpler architecture, and statelessness makes them more fault-tolerant.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Caching: REST services are cacheable, while SOAP services are not. REST supports HTTP caching mechanisms to improve performance and scalability."
