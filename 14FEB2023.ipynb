    "Ans: Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to run multiple threads of execution concurrently. A thread is a separate flow of execution within a program, and multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time. In other words, multithreading allows a program to be more efficient by utilizing multiple CPU cores and performing multiple tasks in parallel"

    "Ans: Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of programs that perform I/O or have long-running computations by allowing multiple threads to execute in parallel. This can result in faster response times and increased throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Responsiveness: Multithreading allows a program to remain responsive even when performing lengthy computations or I/O operations. By executing these operations in a separate thread, the main thread can continue to handle user input and other tasks without being blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Better resource utilization: By allowing multiple threads to execute concurrently, a program can better utilize the available resources and make better use of idle time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Simplified design: Multithreading can simplify the design of some programs by allowing them to be broken up into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be executed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Complexity: Multithreaded programs are often more complex than single-threaded programs, as they can require careful synchronization and coordination to ensure that threads do not interfere with each other or access shared resources in an unsafe way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Difficult to debug: Multithreaded programs can be difficult to debug, as race conditions and other concurrency-related issues can be hard to reproduce and diagnose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Increased memory usage: Multithreaded programs can use more memory than single-threaded programs, as each thread requires its own stack and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Thread starvation: In some cases, a poorly-designed multithreaded program can result in certain threads being starved of resources or unable to make progress.\n",
