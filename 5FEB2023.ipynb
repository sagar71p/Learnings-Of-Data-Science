    "Inheritance is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. The existing class is called the \"parent\" or \"superclass,\" and the new class is called the \"child\" or \"subclass.\" Here are the main types of inheritance and an example for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single parent class. For example, a class \"Car\" can be the parent class and a class \"Sedan\" can be the child class, inheriting properties and methods from \"Car\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Multilevel Inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a subclass is derived from a parent class, which itself is derived from another parent class. For example, a class \"Animal\" can be the parent class, a class \"Mammal\" can inherit from \"Animal\", and a class \"Cat\" can inherit from \"Mammal\", inheriting properties and methods from all of its parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Hierarchical Inheritance: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class. For example, a class \"Vehicle\" can be the parent class, and classes \"Car\", \"Bus\", and \"Truck\" can be child classes, all inheriting properties and methods from \"Vehicle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Multiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a subclass inherits properties and methods from multiple parent classes. For example, a class \"Bird\" can inherit properties and methods from both \"Animal\" and \"Flyable\" parent classes, allowing it to exhibit behavior and characteristics of both parent classes. Note that multiple inheritance can be complex and is not supported by all programming languages"
